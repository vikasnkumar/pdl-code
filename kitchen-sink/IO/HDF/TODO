    Internally, everything should be using Class::Accessor methods, to seperate the naming semantics...
    
    I've always wanted better error handling, but that's a little ambitious for this version.
    The current error handling is to just die, but that's a major pain, since you may just want
        to open HDF files as a test and do something else if it fails.
        If the sub doesn't just die(), then it returns alls sorts of things currently (0, [], undef)
        
    I prefer lazy population of information, as it speeds up doing simple things on the files 
        greatly. [NOTE: I've also written my own HDF4 C++ lib, and it works great there].
        
    Real OO re-design and re-implementation (not for this version, though).
