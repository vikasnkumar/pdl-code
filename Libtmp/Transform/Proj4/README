PREREQUISITES

    Proj4 C library (tested with 4.4.5)
    Perl            (tested with 5.8.0)
    PDL             (tested with 2.3.4 with BadVals)

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Install the Proj4 library if you haven't already.

    2. Edit the Makefile.PL to point the $proj4_include_path and $proj4_lib_path variables
        to your installation of the Proj4 library.

    3. Make the makefiles with the command:
        shell> perl Makefile.PL

    4. Build the software with the command:
        shell> make

    5. Install the software with the command:
        shell> make install

    6. Test the software (option) using the included script test_proj4.pl.
        NOTE: There are no regression tests yet, but if something is wrong with the install,
        it will probably break the test script.

USAGE

    See the POD in the lib itself, and check out the test script.
